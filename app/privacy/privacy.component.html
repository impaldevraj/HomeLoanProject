    Things to Know About a Basic Credit Card<br>
Although basic credit cards are generally consistent across financial institutions, that doesn't mean they have the same terms to give. Usually, the interest rate on the card would depend on the credit score on the cardholder. As with other credit cards, the card issuer will not charge any interest if the cardholder pays the balance amount in full on time each month.<br>

The credit company issuer offers cardholders a line of credit (LOC), allowing them to borrow money in the form of cash advances. Issuers typically pre-set borrowing limits on the basis of the credit rating of a person. A vast majority of companies let the customer make purchases with credit cards, which remain one of today's most common methods of payment to buy consumer goods and services.<br>

Individuals with poor credit history pursue secured credit cards, which require cash deposits; such cards provide them with proportionate credit lines.<br>
